Feature 1: Server messages that track who leaves and joins the room. As you can see

Creative Portion:

- User Join/Leave Notifications: Implemented real-time notifications for when users join or leave a chat room. When a user enters a new chat room or disconnects from an existing one, the server broadcasts a message to the chatroom specifying the username and the chat room involved, ensuring all participants are informed. 

- Emoji User Icons: When selecting a nickname, users can also choose an avatar from a dropdown of emoji icons. This chosen emoji becomes part of their profile and appears next to their nickname in all messages they send.

- Emoji Message Buttons: Users have the option to send emojis as standalone messages by clicking dedicated emoji buttons. The sendMessage function has been adapted to recognize when a message contains only an emoji, handling its transmission to the chat log as a distinct message type.
